# Arrow-rs and Chrono trait conflict preventing iOS static library compilation

## Problem

I'm building a Rust static library for iOS that uses both Apache Arrow (`arrow-rs`) and Chrono for data export functionality. The compilation fails due to a trait method name collision between Arrow's `ChronoDateExt::quarter()` and Chrono's `Datelike::quarter()`.

## Error Message

```
error[E0034]: multiple applicable items in scope

## Current Dependencies (Cargo.toml)

```toml
[dependencies]
# Core async/serialization
tokio = { version = "1.44.1", features = ["full"] }
futures = "0.3"
tokio-stream = "0.1"
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"

# Time handling
uuid = { version = "1.16.0", features = ["serde", "v4"] }
chrono = { version = "0.4.38", features = ["serde"] }  # Also tried 0.4.40

# Data processing - THESE CAUSE THE CONFLICT
arrow = { version = "51.0.0", features = ["csv"] }     # Also tried 52.0.0
parquet = { version = "51.0.0", features = ["async"] }

# Database
sqlx = { version = "0.8.3", features = ["runtime-tokio-rustls", "macros", "sqlite"] }

# File/compression
csv = "1.3.1"
flate2 = "1.1.0"

[lib]
crate-type = ["staticlib"]  # For iOS integration
```

## Use Case

I need to export large datasets from SQLite to multiple formats (CSV, Parquet, JSONL) for an iOS app. The exports need to:

1. **Work offline** (crucial for iOS static library)
2. Stream large datasets efficiently 
3. Support iOS background processing
4. Handle memory pressure on mobile devices

## What I've Tried

### 1. Different Version Combinations
```toml
# Attempt 1: Latest versions
arrow = "52.0.0"
chrono = "0.4.40"

# Attempt 2: Older Arrow
arrow = "51.0.0" 
chrono = "0.4.40"

# Attempt 3: Older Chrono  
arrow = "51.0.0"
chrono = "0.4.38"
```

### 2. Explicit Trait Disambiguation (doesn't work - in external crate)
The error occurs in Arrow's own code, so I can't modify it:

```rust
// This would work if it was in my code, but the error is in arrow-arith crate
DatePart::Quarter => |d| Datelike::quarter(&d) as i32,  // Can't modify this
```

### 3. Dependency Resolution Commands
```bash
cargo clean
cargo update arrow parquet chrono
cargo check  # Still fails
```

## Current Workaround (Not Ideal)

Temporarily disabled Arrow/Parquet:

```toml
# Export format support - DISABLED DUE TO CONFLICTS
# arrow = { version = "51.0.0", features = ["csv"] }
# parquet = { version = "51.0.0", features = ["async"] }
```

But this breaks my streaming data export functionality:

```rust
// This code now fails to compile without Arrow
use arrow::record_batch::RecordBatch;
use parquet::file::writer::InMemoryWriter;

pub async fn export_to_parquet(&self, data: Vec<MyStruct>) -> Result<Vec<u8>, ExportError> {
    // Need Arrow/Parquet for efficient columnar export
    let schema = Schema::new(vec![
        Field::new("id", DataType::Utf8, false),
        Field::new("title", DataType::Utf8, true),
        Field::new("created_at", DataType::Timestamp(TimeUnit::Microsecond, None), false),
    ]);
    
    // Convert data to RecordBatch and write as Parquet...
}
```

## Questions

1. **Is there a specific combination of Arrow + Chrono versions that avoids this conflict?**

2. **Are there any Cargo features I can disable to avoid the problematic code path in Arrow?**

3. **Is there an alternative to `arrow-rs` that provides similar functionality without Chrono conflicts?**

4. **For iOS static library builds specifically, what's the recommended approach for handling this?**

## Additional Context

- **Target**: iOS static library (offline requirement)
- **Data size**: 10K-100K records per export
- **Performance**: Must handle background processing with memory constraints
- **Formats needed**: CSV (working), JSONL (working), Parquet (blocked by this issue)

## Minimal Reproducible Example

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[package]
name = "arrow-chrono-conflict"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[lib]
crate-type = ["staticlib"]

[dependencies]
chrono = { version = "0.4.40", features = ["serde"] }
arrow = { version = "51.0.0", features = ["csv"] }
```

```rust
// lib.rs - This alone triggers the conflict
use chrono::{DateTime, Utc};
use arrow::csv::Reader;

pub fn test_function() {
    let _now: DateTime<Utc> = Utc::now();
    println!("If this compiles, the conflict is resolved!");
}
```

```bash
# Run this to reproduce
cargo check
# Results in the quarter() method conflict error
```

Any guidance on resolving this for production iOS deployment would be greatly appreciated!
